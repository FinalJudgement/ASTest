-=Arcade Salvation LLC=-

I've been repairing Arcade and Pinball machines for 20 years.

I do both on-site repairs, or you can send me your bad boards. I have test fixtures to troubleshoot and repair Jamma, Non Jamma, and monitor chassis boards (you don't need to send me your tube; I have plenty).

I also have some boards for advance replacements. Call for inquiries. 

If you have a monitor , the colors look dull, or the picture doesn't have the same crisp feel to it. I have a tube rejuvenator that can clean, balances and rejuvenates the tube. This will make those old dull colors vibrant again. This process takes about 15 minutes and is worth it for old, tired tubes to get a second wind.

I also sell electronics chips, fly back, power transistors, eprom. I have a lot of new old stock of end of line parts.
